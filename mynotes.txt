Wikipedia projects vary in how they divide dialects and variants. For example, 
the English Wikipedia includes most modern varieties of English including American 
English and British English.[6][7] Similarly, the Spanish Wikipedia includes both Peninsular 
Spanish and Latin American Spanish,[8] and the Portuguese Wikipedia includes both European Portuguese and 
Brazilian Portuguese.[9] In contrast, some languages have multiple Wikipedias. For example, Serbo-Croatian
 encompasses four Wikipedia editions, 
Serbo-Croatian and three different standardized varieties (Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian).[10]
